The House Price Prediction project aims to develop a model that accurately estimates property prices based on various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and other relevant attributes. This project leverages data science techniques, including Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and machine learning, to provide insights into the housing market and support potential buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals.
